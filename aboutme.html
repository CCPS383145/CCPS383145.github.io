    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In my personal life, I am working towards maintaining healthy relationships in all aspects of my life. In my professional life, I am working towards keeping a steady job that pays enough to support me and my family. I would like to take a teaching program in college to help me move in the direction of becoming a teacher, since that is my actual passion. Experiences that let me here are living in a small house with my father, uncle, and grandfather and living in a hotel with my mother. I've learned to keep relationships well nurtured because I was growing up in small spaces and I want to support family and friends. I am working toward these goals by thinking positive thoughts as much as I can. Keeping a healthy mind will help create a healthy life. I've always struggled with picking negative thoughts over positive ones and it can affect mental and physical states. Some of my core values are being a hard worker and honesty. Being a hard worker is important to me because if your going to do anything or complete something, might as well put in maximum effort to make it perfect; no matter what it is. Honesty is important to me because they're is no point in lying about anything. Maybe you made a mistake, or you said something you shouldn't have, lying or not telling the truth about it won't make anything better. In the near future, some goals I plan to accomplish to continue maintaining a 4.0 GPA, moving up into honors classes, and graduating. Some character traits I want to be known for are being kind, a friend to everyone, smart, honest, and loyal. All these attributes are important to me and I think it would be a good accomplishment to be recognized as having them.</p>
